# Personal-Budget
 A simple easy to use personal budget application made solely for my developer portfolio.

 This app is built with React, Axios , Express and Node. It is a simple REST API.

 Idea was from a project issued from Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Course.

 React bootstrap was used for styling purposes, for cleaner looking tables. Bootstrap enabling code can be found in index.html
